Higher Order Functions

Currying ...

Fixed Points
. values of x for which f(x) = x

Data abstraction -- ability to choose different implementations of the data w/out affecting clients

Operators
. infix:
 -- instead of writing:

r.add(s)
r.less(s)
r.max(s)

you can write:

r add s
r less s
r max s

. operators can be alphanumeric or symbolic

So, instead of a method called 'less', you can call it '<'

. Unary operators
 -- '-' can be used for both substration (i.e., if it's a method that takes an argument), or it can be unary, i.e. it is
 placed in front of a value to make it negative
 -- for the latter, method name would be 'unary_-'

Operator Precedence
. in increasing order of precedence:

  anything that starts with a letter
  |
  ^
  &
  < >
  = !
  :
  + -
  * / %
  all other special characters

So, for this:
a + b ^? c ?^ d less a ==> b | c

Parenthesis added without changing anything:
((a + b) ^? (c ?^ d)) less ((a ==> b) | c)
