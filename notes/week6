val j = (1 until n) flatMap (i =>
  (1 until i) map (j => (i, j))) filter (pair => isPrime(pair._1 + pair._2))


The above creates a list of pairs of numbers and filters out ones whose individual values don't equal a prime number

But it's hard to read
How to make this easier?

For expressions
. basically similar to imperative for loops, but they build lists of the result of iterations, whereas traditional
  for loops rely on side-effects happening within them

for (s) yield e

s is a sequence of generators (p <- e) and filters
can be multiple generators

same as above with for:

for {
  i <- 1 until n
  j <- 1 until i
  if isPrime(i + j)
} yield (i, j)
